She was very conscious about the pain during the\nprocedure as well. During the examination the vulva and vagina were very atrophic. | applied\nclear gel and removed the pessary. The pessary was clean with no discharge or any bleeding.\nThere was a small area of about 2-3 mms at the vaginal forchette area which was bleeding\nprobably because it was opened up by the pessary removal. | have apologised for this\nhappening during the examination despite using a lot of gel. | have taken a HVS and have it to\nthe lab but on speculum examination | couldn’t see any areas of ulcers, bleeding or discharge\npresent inside even though the vaginal mucosa was very dry and atrophic. | have re fitted her\nwith a 65 mm size pessary without any difficulty. She has been advised to use vaginal oestrogen\ncream twice a week by you but she has stopped using this for a while. | have advised her to\ncontinue using this again and my plan is that we will chase the HVS results. We will contact her\nif she needs any treatment. We will change the pessary and re examine her in 4 months’ time. |\nhave reassured her that this bleeding wasn’t coming internally from the vagina or around the\ncervix or area of the pessary which was pressing inside the vagina.",
