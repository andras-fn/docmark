When I got through your receptionist was extremely rude to me. I am fully aware that there is a national emergency going on with this common cold virus but I needed you to look at my warts on my hand. I understand that warts are due to a virus but I have been isolating so where has this virus come from? I need your professional opinion, I do not want to be told that you have more important things to do. What is more important than the wellbeing of your patients? I want to make a formal complaint against Ms Robinson. She was uncaring and downright rude to me, it is people like her who give the NHS a bad name. Yours sincerely Ivor Headache",
